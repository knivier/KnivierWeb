# Knivier Web
## A simple web portfolio that works
Welcome to the `readme.md` of my portfolio website!

### Created via template, heavily modified (source: see footer)
Not created via template:
* All images
* CSS modifications 
* Most animations
* Colour changes to all # sections
* Dropdown "skill" section
* Image animations (banners)
* Different project sections 
* Contact system (customized heavily)
* All of `activerseinfo.html` and following JS & CSS
* All of `actversions.html` and following JS & CSS
* All of `trollgameinfo.html` and following JS & CSS
*  Other things (referenced)

These modifications make this website rights reserved under the creative commons license. You 
must provide credit to the original author **and me** if you choose to replicate this website.

A lot of the website is always being customized and worked on. Certain sections may be under construction. This
website is NOT like my other projects where you're encouraged to download the src code and play around with it/add on (
following license guidelines ofc). When changing things to this website, you are assuming full liability, I (Knivier) do not provide
any support for this website.
