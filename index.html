			<p>This is my portfolio or informatics page, where you can find lots of information about me. I decided not
				to go with a regular site hoster, so this website has been created
				under a template from HTML5Up. If you want to see my custom websites that I did build, you can find them
				in the work section.</p>

			<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
			<span class="image main"><img src="src/images/aboutmePic.png" alt=""/></span>
			<p>Hello, I'm Agniva, or known online as Knivier. I'm a 15-year-old High School Junior that also loves to
				code, play tennis, and learn interesting things. You won't find my CV or resumes here due to privacy
				reasons. However, if you're a company or organisation that wants to reach out for my resumes, you can
				contact me!</p>
			<p>My primary activity is coding, which will be dominantly featured on here. I've also gone to some
				competitions during the 2023:24 school year, which include MSU, EMU (8<sup>th</sup> place), and SVSU. My
				experience is as follows: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Web Design: 3 Years of using HTML & CSS</li>
				<li>Python: Around 1-2 years of basic experience and knowledge via Python</li>
				<li>Java: My primary coding language, I have ~1.5 years of knowledge and also took AP-CSA. You'll find
					most of my projects coded in Java
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I'm also always interested in learning new programming languages. My current coding goals include
				advancing my Java knowledge even farther, and having an intermediate level of knowledge in
				JavaScript.</p>

			<p>This part of my website is a compilation of my works from too much free-time, to class projects I deeply admire.
				Some of my work is updated, other parts are not. When citing my work or using it for alternative purposes, please

				<!-- Project 1 -->
				<div class="project">
					<h3>Activerse</h3>
					<p>My biggest project to date as of right now, Activerse is a Java-based game engine meant to help people create
					games by simplifying the GUI experience. I was inspired by Greenfoot but annoyed from the lack of customization and descriptions regarding
					how Greenfoot initially worked, and I wanted a more customizable version of which I could modify the source code. From a library to engine, this is
					my biggest project to date. For more information on how to use this project, you can check out the Wiki which has all the quick start guides you'll need.</p>
					<a href="https://github.com/knivier/Activerse" class="button project-button">Activerse Project</a>
				</div>
				<div class="project">
					<h3>Troll Game</h3>
					<p>Troll Game is a simple text-based game that uses logic and lots of randomization to make each play seem different from the previous. I created
					this game for my AP-CSA midterm, and I've tried to keep it alive to this day! While updates are on the slower slide, it's still a well polished game that can
					be entertaining (depending on your genre type). </p>
