        <h2>From the Creator</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Knivier! I'm the solo developer behind Troll Game, created in January 2024. Since then, I've
            continued to update this text-based game into something more complex, yet easy to learn. This website serves
            as a guide for new players and updates on the game's development.</p>

        <h2>Game Information</h2>
        <h3>The Game</h3>
        <p>Troll Game puts you in charge of leading the trolls, engaged in an eternal battle against Archie the Dragon.
            Choose between Ranked Mode for quick gameplay focused on earning money, or Adventure Mode (in progress) for
            a deeper dive into the game mechanics.</p>

        <h3>How to Get Playing?</h3>
        <p>To start playing, download the JAR file and ensure you have Java JDK 17 or higher installed. Optionally, use
            the run.bat file to launch the game without a terminal. Visit <a
                    href="https://github.com/knivier/trollgame/releases/tag/v4.4">GitHub</a> for the latest version.</p>

        <h3>Can I Contribute?</h3>
        <p>You can mod the game using IntelliJ IDEA or BlueJ. For modding details, visit the <a
